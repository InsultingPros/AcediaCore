/**
 *  One of the two classes that make up a core of event system in Acedia.
 *  
 *      'Listener' (or it's child) class shouldn't be instantiated.
 *      Usually module would provide '...ListenerBase' class that defines
 *  certain set of static functions, corresponding to events it can listen to.
 *  In order to handle those events you must create it's child class and
 *  override said functions. But they will only be called if
 *  'SetActive(true)' is called for that child class.
 *      To create you own '...ListenerBase' class you need to define
 *  a static function for each event you wish it to catch and
 *  set 'relatedEvents' variable to point at the 'Events' class
 *  that will generate your events.
 *      For concrete example look at
 *  'ConnectionEvents' and 'ConnectionListenerBase'.
