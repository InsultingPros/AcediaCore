//      Forcing Acedia's own `BroadcastHandler` is rather invasive and might be
//  undesired, since it can lead to incompatibilities with some mutators.
//      To alleviate this issue Acedia allows server admins to control how it's
//  `BroadcastHandler` is injected. Do note however that anything other than
//  `BHIJ_Root` can lead to issues with Acedia's features.

/**
 *      To understand how what our broadcast handler does, let us first explain
 *  how `BroadcastHandler` classes work. Here we skip voice and speech
 *  broadcasting topics, since they are not something Acedia or this class
 *  currently uses.
 *      `BroadcastHandler`s are capable of forming a one-way linked list by
 *  referring to the next `BroadcastHandler` by `nextBroadcastHandler` and
 *  `nextBroadcastHandlerClass` variables. New `BroadcastHandler`s can be added
 *  via `RegisterBroadcastHandler()` method.
 *      Actual broadcasting of the messages is done by calling one of
 *  the three methods: `Broadcast()`, `BroadcastTeam()` and weirdly named
 *  `AllowBroadcastLocalized()` on the root `BroadcastHandler` (stored in
 *  the current `GameInfo`). These methods are only ever called for the root
 *  `BroadcastHandler` and **are not** propagated down the chain.
 *  This leads to...
 *      ISSUE 1: we cannot reliably detect start of the message propagation with
 *  `BroadcastHandler` unless we are at the root of the linked list. This is why
 *  it is important for Acedia to use `BHIJ_Root` method for its
 *  `BroadcastHandler`.
 *
 *      First we will look into `Broadcast()` and `BroadcastTeam()` methods.
 *  First thing either of them does is to call `AllowsBroadcast()` method that
 *  checks whether message is allowed to be broadcasted at all. It is also only
 *  called for the root `BroadcastHandler`, but allows other `BroadcastHandler`s
 *  to block the message for their own reasons by propagating
 *  `HandlerAllowsBroadcast()` method down the chain.
 *      Then they call `BroadcastText()` for every acceptable player controller
 *  they find and the only difference between `Broadcast()` and
 *  `BroadcastTeam()` is that the latter also checks to that they belong to the
 *  same team as the sender.
 *      `BroadcastText()` is propagated down the linked list of
 *  the `BroadcastHandler`s (allowing them to modify or discard message) and,
 *  once list is exhausted, calls `TeamMessage()` method. However it also
 *  propagates additional method `AcceptBroadcastText()` down the linked list.
 *  Supposedly it's `AcceptBroadcastText()` that you should overload when making
 *  your own `BroadcastHandler`, but this setup creates...
 *      ISSUE 2: by default `AcceptBroadcastText()` is propagated ANEW
 *  inside EVERY `BroadcastText()` call (that is also propagated). This means
 *  that if there is several `BroadcastHandler`s in the chain before yours -
 *  every single one of them (including your own!) will call
 *  `AcceptBroadcastText()` for you. This means that `AcceptBroadcastText()` is
 *  going to be called several times for every broadcasted message unless your
 *  `BroadcastHandler` is added at the very root of the linked list.
 *
 *      All that remains is to consider `AllowBroadcastLocalized()` method.
 *  It works in similar way to the previous two, but is simpler: it does not
 *  have an analogue to the `AllowsBroadcast()` method and simply calls
 *  `BroadcastLocalized()` for every player controller, spectator or not.
 *  `BroadcastLocalized()` works exactly the same way as `BroadcastText()`, but
 *  with uses `AcceptBroadcastLocalized()` instead of `AcceptBroadcastText()`,
 *  completely mirroring issue 2.
 *
 *  Summary.
 *  Methods only called for root `BroadcastHandler`:
 *      1. `Broadcast()` - starts text message broadcast;
 *      2. `BroadcastTeam()` - starts team text message broadcast;
 *      3. `AllowBroadcastLocalized()` - starts localized message broadcast;
 *      4. `AllowsBroadcast()` - called for text message broadcasts (team or
 *          not) to check if they are allowed.
 *  Methods that are propagated down the linked list of `BroadcastHandler`s:
 *      1. `HandlerAllowsBroadcast()` - called before broadcasting text message
 *          (team or not), before any `BroadcastText()` or
 *          `AcceptBroadcastText()` call;
 *      2. `BroadcastText()` - once for every controller that should receive
 *          a certain text message (unless blocked at some point);
 *      3. `AcceptBroadcastText()` - called shit ton of times inside
 *          `BroadcastText()` to check if message can be propagated;
 *      4. `BroadcastLocalized()` - once for every controller that should
 *          receive a certain text message (unless blocked at some point);
 *      5. `AcceptBroadcastLocalized()` - called shit ton of times inside
 *          `BroadcastLocalized()` to check if message can be propagated;
 *
 *  What are we going to do?
 *      We want our `BroadcastHandler` to work at any place inside the
 *  linked list, but also to side step issue 2 completely, so we will use
 *  `BroadcastText()` and `BroadcastLocalized()` methods for catching messages
 *  sent to particular players. We do not want to reimplement `Broadcast()`,
 *  `BroadcastTeam()` or `AllowBroadcastLocalized()` (partially because it would
 *  mostly involve copy-pasting copyrighted code) and will instead inject some
 *  code to reliably catch the moment broadcast has started in case we are
 *  actually placed at the root.
 *      We also want to track broadcast by message parameters in
 *  `BroadcastText()` and `BroadcastLocalized()` methods in case we are not
 *  injected at the root to resolve issue 1. When we detect any difference in
 *  passed parameters (or players message was broadcasted to get repeated) -
 *  we declare a new broadcast. This methods is not perfect, but is likely
 *  the best possible guess for the start of broadcast.

//      This is only relevant for `BHIJ_Root` injection level.
//      The way vanilla `BroadcastHandler` works - it can check if broadcast is
//  possible for any actor, but for actually sending the text messages it will
//  try to extract `PlayerReplicationInfo` from it and will simply pass `none`
//  for a sender if it can't.
//      We remember senders in this array in order to pass real ones to
//  our events.
//      We use an array instead of a single variable is to account for possible
//  folded calls (when handling of broadcast events leads to another
//  message generation).
var private array<Actor> storedSenders;

//      This is only relevant for `BHIJ_Root` injection level.
//      We do not want to reimplement functions `Broadcast()`, `BroadcastTeam()`
//  or `AllowBroadcastLocalized()` that root `BroadcastHandler` calls to do
//  checks and send messages to individual players.
//  Instead we would like to inject our own code and call parent version of
//  these methods.
//      We would also like to insert our code in some of the functions between
//  `AllowsBroadcast()` check and actual broadcasting, so we cannot simply use
//  a `super.AllowsBroadcast()` call that calls both of them in order.
//      Instead we move `AllowsBroadcast()` unto our own methods:
//  we first manually do `AllowsBroadcast()` check, then perform our logic and
//  then make a super call, but with `blockAllowsBroadcast` flag set to `true`,
//  which causes overloaded `AllowsBroadcast()` to omit checks that we've
//  already performed.
var private bool blockAllowsBroadcast;

/*
 *      In case of `BHIJ_Registered` injection level, we do not get notified
 *  when a message starts getting broadcasted through `Broadcast()`,
 *  `BroadcastTeam()` and `AcceptBroadcastLocalized()`.
 *      Instead we are only notified when a message is broadcasted to
 *  a particular player, so with 2 players instead of sequence `Broadcast()`,
 *  `AcceptBroadcastText()`, `AcceptBroadcastText()`
 *  we get `AcceptBroadcastText()`, `AcceptBroadcastText()`.
 *      This means that we can only guess when new broadcast was initiated.
 *  We do this by:
 *      1. Recording broadcast instigator (sender) and his message. If any of
 *          these variables change - we assume it's a new broadcast.
 *      2. Recording players that already received that message, - if message is
 *          resend to one of them - it's a new broadcast
 *          (of possibly duplicate message).
 *      3. All broadcasted messages are sent to all players within 1 tick, so
 *          any first message within each tick is a start of a new broadcast.
 *
 *      Check logic is implemented in `UpdateTrackingWithTextMessage()` and
 *  `UpdateTrackingWithLocalizedMessage()` methods.
