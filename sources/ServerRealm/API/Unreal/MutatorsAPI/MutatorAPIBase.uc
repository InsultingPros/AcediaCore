/**
 *      Called whenever mutators (Acedia's mutator) is asked to check whether
 *  an `Actor` should be replaced. This check is done right after that `Actor`
 *  has spawned.
 *
 *      This check is called in UnrealScript and defined in base `Actor` class
 *  inside `PreBeginPlay()` event. It makes each `Actor` call base mutator's
 *  (the one linked as the head of the mutator linked list in `GameInfo`)
 *  `CheckRelevance()` method for itself as long as it has
 *  `bGameRelevant == false` and current `NetMode` is not `NM_Client`.
 *      `CheckRelevance()` is only called on the base mutator and always first
 *  checks with `AlwaysKeep()` method, that allows any mutator to prevent any
 *  further check altogether and then `IsRelevant()` check that then calls
 *  sub-check `CheckReplacement()` this signal catches.
 *      Any described event that is not `CheckRelevance()` is propagated through
 *  the linked mutator list.
 *
 *  [Signature]
 *  bool <slot>(Actor other, out byte isSuperRelevant)
 *
 *  @param  other           `Actor` that is checked for
 *      replacement / modification.
 *  @param  isSuperRelevant Variable with unclear intention. It is defined in
 *      base mutator's `CheckRelevance()` method as a local variable and then
 *      passed as an `out` parameter for `IsRelevant()` and `CheckRelevance()`
 *      checks and not really used for anything once these checks are complete.
 *      Some [sources]
 *      (https://wiki.beyondunreal.com/Legacy:Chain_Of_Events_At_Level_Startup)
 *      indicate that it is used to omit additional `GameInfo`'s
 *      relevancy checks, however it does not seem to serve any function in
 *      Killing Floor.
 *      Mutators might repurpose it for their own uses, but I am not aware of
 *      any that do.
 *  @return `false` if you want `other` to be destroyed and `true` otherwise.
