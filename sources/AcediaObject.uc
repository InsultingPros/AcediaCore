/**
 *      Object base class to be used to Acedia instead of an `Object`.
 *  The only difference is defined `_` member that provides convenient access to
 *  Acedia's API.
 *      Since `Global` is an actor, we wish to avoid storing it's instance in
 *  the object because it can mess with garbage collection on level change.
 *  So we provide an accessor function `_()` instead.
