/**
 *  # Side effects
 *
 *      In Acedia "side effect" refers to changes that aren't a part of mod's
 *  main functionality, but rather something necessary to make that
 *  functionality possible that might also affect how other mods work. Their
 *  purpose is to help developers and server admins figure out what changes were
 *  performed by Acedia or mods based on it.
 *      What needs to be considered a side effect is loosely defined and they
 *  are simply a tool to inform others that something they might not have
 *  expected has happened, that can possibly break other (their) mods.
 *      AcediaCore, for example, tried to leave a minimal footpring, avoiding
 *  making any changes to the game classes unless requested, but it still has to
 *  do some changes (adding `GameRules`, replacing damage types for some zeds,
 *  etc.) and `SideEffect`s can be used to document these changes. They can be
 *  used in a similar way for AcediaFixes - a package that is only meant for
 *  fixing bugs, but inevitably has to make a lot of under the hood changes to
 *  achieve that.
 *      On the other hand gameplay mods like Futility can make a lot of changes,
 *  but they can all be just expected part of its direct functionality: we
 *  expect feature that shares dosh of leavers to alter players' dosh values, so
 *  this is not a side effect. Such mods are likely not going to have to specify
 *  any side effects whatsoever.
 *
 *  ## Implementiong your own `SideEffect`s
 *
 *      Simply make a non-abstract child class based on `SideEffect`, create its
 *  instance filled with necessary data and register it in `SideEffectAPI` once
 *  side effect is introduced. If you revert introduced side effect, you should
 *  remove registered object through the same API.
 *      Each class of the `SideEffect` is supposed to represent a particular
 *  side effect introduced into the game engine. Whether side effect is active
 *  is decided by whether it is currently registered in `SideEffectAPI`.
 *
 *  NOTE: `SideEffect` should not have any logic and should serve as
 *  an immutable data container.
