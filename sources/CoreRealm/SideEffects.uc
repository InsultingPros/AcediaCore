/**
 *      Unfortunately, thanks to the TWI's code, there's no way to catch events
 *  of when certain kinds of damage are dealt: from welder, bloat's bile and
 *  siren's scream. At least not without something drastic, like replacing game
 *  type class.
 *      As a workaround, Acedia can optionally replace bloat and siren damage
 *  type to at least catch damage dealt by zeds (as being dealt welder damage is
 *  pretty rare and insignificant). This change has several unfortunate
 *  side-effects:
 *      1. Potentially breaking mods that are looking for `DamTypeVomit` and
 *          `SirenScreamDamage` damage types specifically. Fixing this issue
 *          would require these mods to either also try and catch Acedia's
 *          replacements `AcediaCore.Dummy_DamTypeVomit` and
 *          `AcediaCore.Dummy_SirenScreamDamage` or to catch any child classes
 *          of `DamTypeVomit` and `SirenScreamDamage` (as Acedia's replacements
 *          are also their child classes).
 *      2. Breaking some achievements that rely on
 *          `KFSteamStatsAndAchievements`'s `KilledEnemyWithBloatAcid()` method
 *          being called. This is mostly dealt with by Acedia calling it
 *          manually. However it relies on killed pawn to have
 *          `lastDamagedByType` set to `DamTypeVomit`, which sometimes might not
 *          be the case. Achievements should still be obtainable.
 *      3. A lot of siren's visual damage effects code does direct checks for
 *          `SirenScreamDamage` class. These can also break, stopping working as
 *          intended.

/**
 *      Acedia requires injecting its own `BroadcastHandler` to listen to
 *  the broadcasted messages.
 *      It's normal for a mod to add its own broadcast handler: broadcast
 *  handlers are implemented in such a way that they form a linked list and,
 *  after first (root) handler receives a message it tells about said message to
 *  the next handler, which does the same, propagating messages through
 *  the whole list.
 *      If you do not wish Acedia to add its own handler, you should specify
 *  `BHIJ_None` as `broadcastHandlerInjectionLevel`'s value. If you want to
 *  allow it to simply add its broadcast handler to the end of the handler's
 *  linked list, as described above, set it to `BHIJ_Registered`.
 *      However, more information can be obtained if Acedia's broadcast handler
 *  is inserted at the root of the whole chain. This is the preferred way for
 *  Acedia and if you do not have a reason to forbid that (for example, for mod
 *  compatibility reasons), you should set this value at `BHIJ_Root`.
