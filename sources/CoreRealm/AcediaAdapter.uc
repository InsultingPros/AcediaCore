/**
 *  # `AcediaAdapter`
 *
 *      Acedia provides a set of APIs through `...Global`s objects
 *  `_` (for everything), `_server` (for servers) and `_client` (for clients).
 *  The functionality in common API set `_` is hardcoded, but Acedia allows
 *  users to provide their own implementation of `_server`'s and/or `_client`'s
 *  functionality to extend them, offer compatibility with other mods, etc..
 *  This replacement is done through `AcediaAdapter` classes that serve as
 *  a collection of API classes to be used in `_server` or `_client`.
 *  All one needs to do to use a different set of server/client APIs is to
 *  specify desired `AcediaAdapter` before loading server/client core.
